Project created for the Hackaton Applitools 2019, the main idea was to use NightwatchJS for creating the first tests and see how the application worked, and them, create the full JS + Selenium project.

For installing the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

For running on Windows:
```
set ENV=APPOK & npm test = RUN OK ON WINDOWS
set ENV=APPNOK & npm test = RUN NOK ON WINDOWS
```

For running on Linux:
```
export ENV=APPOK && npm test = RUN OK ON LINUX
export ENV=APPNOK && npm test = RUN NOK ON LINUX
```
