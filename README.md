Project created using nightwatch js just for training, the idea is to use the Selenium with pure JS after the training.

For installing the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

For running on Windows:
```
set ENV=APPOK & npm test = RUN OK ON WINDOWS
set ENV=APPNOK & npm test = RUN NOK ON WINDOWS
```

For running on Linux:
```
export ENV=APPOK && npm test = RUN OK ON LINUX
export ENV=APPNOK && npm test = RUN NOK ON LINUX
```
